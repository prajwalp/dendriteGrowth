# dendriteGrowth

Dendritic growth simulation for Statistical Mechanics of Complex Systems 2022 Course at University of Padova.  

Simulation of dendritic and fractal growth using Dielectric Breakdown Model (DBM or The Laplacian Growth Model) starting from   
diffusion Master equation and assuming very fast equilibriation.  

For students: 
1. Compare the method in the code to Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) algorithm.
2. Include an explicit timescale in the problem and check for growth at larger timescales and see if the broken symmetry is avoided
